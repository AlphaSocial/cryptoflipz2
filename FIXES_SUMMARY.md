# NFT Flipping Game - Comprehensive Fixes Summary

## Issues Addressed

### 1. **Missing Profile API Endpoints** ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: The server was missing profile API endpoints, causing 404 errors when trying to fetch user profiles.

**Solution**: 
- Added `/api/profile/:address` GET endpoint to retrieve user profiles
- Added `/api/profile/:address` PUT endpoint to update user profiles
- Added `user_profiles` table to database schema with fields:
  - `address` (TEXT PRIMARY KEY)
  - `name` (TEXT)
  - `avatar` (TEXT)
  - `heads_image` (TEXT)
  - `tails_image` (TEXT)
  - `created_at` (DATETIME)
  - `updated_at` (DATETIME)

### 2. **Profile Data Not Persisting** ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: User profile data (name, avatar, custom coins) was only stored in localStorage and would reset on page refresh.

**Solution**:
- Updated `ProfileContext.jsx` to use server API instead of localStorage
- Added proper error handling and loading states
- Implemented caching mechanism to avoid repeated API calls
- Added fallback to empty profile when API calls fail

### 3. **Custom Coin Selection Not Working** ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: Custom coin option only appeared when both heads AND tails images were uploaded, but should appear if either exists.

**Solution**:
- Changed condition from `customHeadsImage && customTailsImage` to `customHeadsImage || customTailsImage`
- Added fallback to default coin images when one side is missing
- Updated custom coin preview to show placeholder (?) when image is missing
- Added visual feedback for missing coin sides

### 4. **Wallet Connection Issues** ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: ContractService was throwing "Wallet not connected" errors even when wallet was connected.

**Solution**:
- Updated `getCurrentClients()` method to handle read-only operations with only `publicClient`
- Modified `getUserActiveGames()` to return empty array instead of throwing errors
- Added better error handling for wallet connection states

### 5. **Game Joining Issues** ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: Players were getting "Failed to update game status" errors when trying to join games.

**Solution**:
- Added comprehensive validation in `/api/games/:gameId/simple-join` endpoint
- Added detailed logging for debugging join process
- Added checks for game availability and existing joiners
- Improved error messages and handling

## Technical Changes Made

### Server-Side Changes (`server/server.js`)

     avatar TEXT,
     heads_image TEXT,
     tails_image TEXT,
     created_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
     updated_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
   )
   ```

2. **New API Endpoints**:
   - `GET /api/profile/:address` - Retrieve user profile
   - `PUT /api/profile/:address` - Update user profile

3. **Enhanced Join Process**:
   - Added input validation
   - Added game state checks
   - Added detailed logging
   - Added better error handling

### Client-Side Changes

1. **ProfileContext.jsx**:
   - Replaced localStorage with server API calls
   - Added loading states and error handling
   - Added caching mechanism
   - Added fallback profiles

2. **CoinSelector.jsx**:
   - Fixed custom coin visibility logic
   - Added fallback images for missing coin sides
   - Added visual placeholders for missing images

3. **ContractService.js**:
   - Updated wallet connection handling
   - Added read-only operation support
   - Improved error handling

## How to Test the Fixes

### 1. Profile Persistence
1. Go to your profile and set a name and upload an avatar
2. Refresh the page
3. Verify that the name and avatar persist

### 2. Custom Coin Selection
1. Upload only a heads image (or only tails)
2. Go to Create Flip page
3. Verify that "Your Custom Coin" option appears
4. Select it and verify it works with fallback images

### 3. Game Joining
1. Create a game
2. Have another player try to join
3. Verify the join process completes successfully
4. Check server logs for detailed join process information

### 4. Wallet Connection
1. Connect wallet
2. Navigate to different pages
3. Verify no "Wallet not connected" errors appear
4. Check that active games load properly

## API Endpoints Reference

### Profile Endpoints
```
GET /api/profile/:address
Response: {
  address: string,
  name: string,
  avatar: string,
  headsImage: string,
  tailsImage: string,
  createdAt: string,
  updatedAt: string
}

PUT /api/profile/:address
Body: {
  name?: string,
  avatar?: string,
  headsImage?: string,
  tailsImage?: string
}
Response: {
  success: boolean,
  message: string
}
```

### Game Join Endpoints
```
POST /api/games/:gameId/simple-join
Body: {
  joinerAddress: string,
  paymentTxHash: string,
  paymentAmount?: number
}
Response: {
  success: boolean,
  gameId: string
}
```

## Database Schema

### Games Table
- All existing fields plus `coin` field for storing coin selection data

### User Profiles Table (NEW)
- `address` - User's wallet address (PRIMARY KEY)
- `name` - Display name
- `avatar` - Profile picture (base64 or URL)
- `heads_image` - Custom coin heads image
- `tails_image` - Custom coin tails image
- `created_at` - Profile creation timestamp
- `updated_at` - Last update timestamp

## Error Handling

All endpoints now include:
- Input validation
- Proper error messages
- Detailed logging
- Graceful fallbacks
- HTTP status codes

## Performance Improvements

- Added caching for profile data
- Reduced unnecessary API calls
- Added loading states
- Improved error recovery

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy the updated server** with the new profile endpoints
2. **Test all functionality** with real wallet connections
3. **Monitor server logs** for any remaining issues
4. **Consider adding** profile data validation and sanitization
5. **Add rate limiting** to profile endpoints if needed

## Files Modified

1. `server/server.js` - Added profile API endpoints and improved join process
2. `src/contexts/ProfileContext.jsx` - Updated to use server API
3. `src/components/CoinSelector.jsx` - Fixed custom coin logic
4. `src/services/ContractService.js` - Improved wallet connection handling

All changes are backward compatible and include proper error handling.
