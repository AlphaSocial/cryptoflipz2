# Deposit Timeout Fix Summary

## 🎯 **Issues Fixed**

### 1. **Frontend Initialization Error** ✅ FIXED
- **Problem**: "Cannot access 'Ue' before initialization" error when clicking on games
- **Root Cause**: Circular dependency between `WalletContext` and `useWalletConnection`
- **Solution**: Removed `useWalletConnection` import from `UnifiedGamePage.jsx` and use only `useWallet`

### 2. **Deposit Timeout Issue** ✅ FIXED
- **Problem**: "Cannot deposit - game expired or already completed" error when trying to deposit NFTs
- **Root Cause**: 2-minute deposit timeout was too short, causing timeouts before users could complete deposits
- **Solution**: Increased timeout to 5 minutes and added better error handling

## 🔧 **Changes Made**

### **Smart Contract Updates**
- **File**: `contracts/NFTFlipGame.sol`
- **Change**: Increased `depositTimeout` from 120 seconds (2 minutes) to 300 seconds (5 minutes)
- **Impact**: Users now have 5 minutes to deposit their assets instead of 2 minutes

### **Server-Side Updates**
- **File**: `server/routes/api.js`
- **Change**: Updated deposit deadline calculation from 2 minutes to 5 minutes
- **Impact**: Database deadlines now match the smart contract timeout

### **Frontend Error Handling**
- **File**: `src/services/ContractService.js`
- **Changes**:
  - Added detailed error logging for deposit failures
  - Added timeout debugging information
  - Added game existence and completion checks
  - Added time remaining calculations
- **Impact**: Better error messages help users understand why deposits fail

### **Deployment Script**
- **File**: `scripts/deploy.js`
- **Change**: Added logging to show the new timeout value during deployment
- **Impact**: Clearer deployment process with timeout information

## 📊 **Error Handling Improvements**

### **Before**
```
❌ Error depositing NFT: Error: Cannot deposit - game expired or already completed
```

### **After**
```
🔍 Can deposit check result: false
🔍 Game details for debugging: { player1: '0x...', depositTime: 1234567890, completed: false }
⏰ Timeout debug: { currentTime: 1234567890, depositTime: 1234567890, timeout: '300', timeLeft: -60, isExpired: true }
❌ Error depositing NFT: Error: Deposit timeout expired. Time left: -60 seconds
```

## 🚀 **Deployment Instructions**

1. **Deploy Updated Contract**:
   ```bash
   npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network base-mainnet
   ```

2. **Update Contract Address**:
   - Copy the new contract address from deployment output
   - Update `CONTRACT_ADDRESS` in environment variables
   - Update `src/services/ContractService.js` if needed

3. **Redeploy Frontend**:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

## 🧪 **Testing**

### **Test Cases**
1. **Create a game** and immediately try to deposit → Should work
2. **Wait 3 minutes** then try to deposit → Should work (within 5-minute window)
3. **Wait 6 minutes** then try to deposit → Should fail with clear error message
4. **Check error messages** → Should show detailed timeout information

### **Expected Behavior**
- Users have 5 minutes to deposit after game creation
- Clear error messages when timeouts occur
- No more "Cannot access 'Ue' before initialization" errors
- Better debugging information in console logs

## 📝 **Notes**

- The 5-minute timeout provides a good balance between security and user experience
- Error handling now provides specific information about why deposits fail
- Frontend initialization issues are resolved by removing circular dependencies
- All changes are backward compatible with existing games

## 🔍 **Monitoring**

After deployment, monitor:
- Console logs for timeout debugging information
- User feedback on deposit success rates
- Error message clarity and helpfulness
- Overall game creation and deposit flow success rates
